# Predicting League of Legends Player Division Based on Their In-game Performance

## Goal
To predict a player's division based on their game performance statistics using League of Legends dataset

## Introduction

### What is League of Legends?
League of Legends is currently one of the most played PC game in the world with a monthly active user of 81 million. 
It is a team-based video game consisting of a two 5 player teams where both team must defend their base while simultaneously
trying to destroy the enemy teamâ€™s base. While in game, each player accumulates statistics based on their in-game performance. 
Furthermore, players have their own individual rank/division where they are placed on based on how well they perform in game 
and the amount of time they won.

### Player Rank Prediction 
For this project, I want to predict a playerdivisionbased on their in-game performance. As a player myself I always wonder if there is a substantial difference between the statistics of a high division player vs a low division player. There is a total of seven divisions in League of Legends, but I would only be focusing on five of them since Master and Challengermake up only .07% of player division. Listed below are the division I would be using starting from low division rank to higher division.

1. Bronze
2. Silver
3. Gold
4. Platinum
5. Diamond

## Data Collection and Methods

### Data Collection 
Riot Games the creator of League of Legends providesdevelopersaccess to their own API where developerscan access players match history including their statistics. I created my own python script that took 1000 players for each divisionthat I am trying to classify and tooktheir last 20 rank match history and averagestheir stats. I would have liked to use more match history and more players for each division, but League API have rate limit that prevent me from constantly calling their API.As a result, I have a size of 5000 dataset.
